# JavaCalculator

Calculates the value of expressions giving the integer result.

The expressions must have all their elements separated by spaces. For example "4 * ( 4 + 5 ) - 3" would result in  33. But "3+4" will fail.

The precedence of multiplication, division over addition, substraction does not work.

## Missing parts
- Better tokenizer so no spaces are required.
- Implement precedence of multiplication and division.
- Better error reporting of invalid expressions.
